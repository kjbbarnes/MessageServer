To setup and use the secure encrypted message system:

NOTE: This system may not work on Windows due to an issue with select.select in the code and Windows not liking it.

Step 1: Open up two terminals
Step 2: On the first terminal, run 'sudo python server.py [ip] [port]'
Step 3: On the second terminal, run 'sudo python client.py [ip] [port]'
Step 4: That's it! Now start sending encrypted messages!

NOTE: For the IP, I would recommend using 127.0.0.1 for testing purposes.

NOTE: This system does allow for up to 10 different connections, easily scalable by modifying the source code 'server.listen(10)'
